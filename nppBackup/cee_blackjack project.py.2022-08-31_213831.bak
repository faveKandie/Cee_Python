In this game, there are 13 cards numbered 0 - 12.
The cards are A which could be 1 or 11 depending on your choice.
              2 - 10
              and K, Q and J which gives a value of 10.
You are to draw cards and each time you draw, the computer draws too and you only get to see his first card.
If the sum of your drawn cards is less than 16, you must draw again- Enter yes to continue.
Else you decide. Yes  to continue and no to stop.
If you draw again and the sum of your drawn cards is greater than 21, you are busted and the computer wins.
But if the sum of cards drawn by the computer is greater than 21, you win!
The game begins now!\n
